## Hi :)

# About Me:
The name's Cuppixx or CuppiXD. I'm a hobbyist game developer studying IT/Software. In terms of game development, I've mainly worked with the Godot engine (GDScript) so far, but I've also explored Unreal (C++ + Blueprints), Unity (C#), and Bevy (Rust).
In the field of software development, I've worked with languages like C#, C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript.


I've developed a handful of open-source projects (Assets, Games, Software, Templates) under the MIT license. Some of my personal favorites are also pinned below.

- My Godot-related assets can be found right here on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuppixx?tab=repositories) or on the [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?user=CuppiXD).
- My games and software can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuppixx?tab=repositories) or [itch.io](https://cuppixx.itch.io).


For a comprehensive overview of my projects, take a look at my [portfolio](https://cuppixx.github.io).
