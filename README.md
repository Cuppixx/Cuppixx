## Hi üñê

# About Me:
The name's David ‚Äî or Cuppixx, whichever you prefer. I'm a 23-year-old **hobbyist game developer** living in Germany. I'm currently studying IT Software Systems. 

In terms of game development, I've mainly worked with the **Godot-Engine** (GDScript) so far. I've also explored Unreal (C++ / Blueprints), Unity (C#), and Bevy (Rust).  
  In the field of software development, I'm currently working as a **junior full-stack developer** using React (TypeScript), HTML, and CSS ‚Äî Django (Python), REST, and PostgreSQL ‚Äî in a containerized environment (Docker and Kubernetes).

I've **developed** a handful of **open-source projects** (Assets, Games, Software, Templates) under the MIT license. Some of my personal favorites are also pinned below.

- My Godot-related assets can be found right here on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuppixx?tab=repositories) or on the [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?user=CuppiXD).
- My games and software can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Cuppixx?tab=repositories) or [itch.io](https://cuppixx.itch.io).

I'm also working on a few projects that I hope to one day release on Steam or GOG.

- If I ever manage to release a game or publish one through a publisher, I will add the corresponding links here.
