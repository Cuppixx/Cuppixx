## Hi :)

# About Me:
The name's Cuppixx or CuppiXD. I'm a hobbyist game developer studying IT/Software. In terms of game development, I've mainly worked with the Godot engine (GDScript) so far, but I've also explored Unreal (C++ + Blueprints), Unity (C#), and Bevy (Rust).
In the field of software development, I've worked with languages like C#, C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript.


I've developed a handful of open-source projects (Assets) under the MIT license. Some of my personal favorites are pinned below.
